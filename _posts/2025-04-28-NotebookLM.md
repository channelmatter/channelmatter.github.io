I like it. It's been a little over month since I started using it and while it doesn't meet all of my needs, it does good with context based RAG. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines the best of both worlds--retrieving relevant information from datasets of your choosing (e.g. PDF documents) and generating insightful responses using AI models. This approach enhances accuracy, reduces hallucinations, and makes AI-powered applications simple and reliable.

In a former job role, I recall the arduous (but necessary) task of performing complex pre/post architectural reviews to determine: 1) infosec viability of a new technology and then 2) infosec review of the actual implementation of that new technology. This review cycle required a lot of time from very scarce architect teams. Incurring frequent delays fundementally impacting our organizationâ€™s agility. Using NotebookLM with our own policy, we could have easily streamlined or replaced the initial review by comparing/grading new technologies with our corporate standards. 

With NotebookLM, just add your content and start prompting. Of course you will need to polish up your prompt skills, but if you can find stuff using Google, your really not that far away from creating good AI prompts. The opportunity to take large chunks of data, put them into a large Gemini based context window (1M tokens) with reasonably good semantic logic and confidence inspiring referenced results will provide reliable insights into your data. Upload your domain specific data (policies, operating procedures and log) and instantly gain insights. 

Give it a try, you might like it too.
